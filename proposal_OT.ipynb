    "# Optimal Transport for Image Recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimal transport is a special kind of network flow where we have source nodes and target nodes (and the network flows from sources to targets only). The goal of optimal transport is to find the minimum cost to move mass from source nodes to target nodes. We can represent an image as a matrix of pixels with color intensity. Define the similarity of a source image to a target image by the cost to move the color from pixels of the source to the target. Develop an image recognition algorithm using optimal transport as a measure of similarity.\n",
